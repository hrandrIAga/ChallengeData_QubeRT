# ChallengeData_QubeRT

This repo contain my Codes and Datasets for the Qube Research and Technologies challenge : [How can be explained the price of electricity futures?](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/97/)!

> ranking 111st/619 on 23/11/2023 | **Spearman correlation : 0.2402** (in Progress)

The challenge is to build a model capable of estimating the daily variation of electricity futures contract prices, using various explanatory variables, for both the French and German (24h) futures markets.  
More than just making predictions, the objective is to explain these prices through other concurrent variables.
